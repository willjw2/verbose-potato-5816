## User Stories

```
Story 1

As a visitor, 
When I visit a customer show page,
I see the customer's name,
And I see its a list of its items
including the item's name, price, and the name of the supermarket that it belongs to.
```

```
Story 2

As a visitor,
When I visit a customer's show page,
Then I see a form to add an item to this customer.
When I fill in a field with the id of an existing item,
And I click submit,
Then I am redirected back to the customer's show page, 
And I see the item now listed under this customer's items.
(You do not have to test for a sad path, for example if the ID submitted is not an existing item)
```

```
Story 3

As a visitor,
When I visit the items index page,
Then I see a list of all items
including the item's name, price, and the name of the supermarket that it belongs to
